The AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) is a portable untethered remotely operated vehicle, equipped with a visual mapping system and verified on-board autonomy.
The AUV is capable of conducting light intervention tasks, such as cathodic protection surveys (oil and gas) and simple coring (offshore), with potential to move to more complex interventions in a later phase, such as valve turning.
