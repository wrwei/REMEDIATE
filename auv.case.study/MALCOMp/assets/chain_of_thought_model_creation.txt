Here are some steps to help you create the model that conform to the extracted metamodel, from requirements provided to you.
1. The name of the model to be created is "M", so when you create an instance using the 'new' keyword, try something like: new M!$xxx, where xxx is the name of the meta-class, the object of which you want to create.
2. Identify class instance to create. The class names are often capitalised in the requirements, whilst the identifiers/names of the instance to create normally follow the class name, and are enclosed with quotes (i.e. ""). Write some lines of EOL codes to create the class object using the "new" keyword. Look through your previous answers to determine if an instance has been created, if so, you should retrieve the instance from your previous answers and update it.
3. Identify attributes to set for the class. For each attribute, write some lines of EOL codes to set the attribute based on the requirement input.
4. Identify references to set for the class. For each reference, locate the target of the reference, if it does not exist, write some lines of EOL codes to create the class object to be referenced, and write a line of EOL code to set the object as the target end of the reference.
5. In the requirements when it says "A defines B", it means that A has a containment reference to B. Normally, it means that B shall be created.
