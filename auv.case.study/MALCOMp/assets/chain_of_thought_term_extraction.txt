The requirement statements takes the following form:
"User/Functional/Non-Functional Requirement"{"name": name of the requirement; "gid": the global id of the requirement; "description": the description of the requirement; "***": other features of the requirement}."
Please proceed with the following steps:
1. Extract occurrences of Concept, which represent concepts within the to be developed system. Concepts are often nouns, and are capitalised in the requirement statement. Concepts are never enclosed in quotes (i.e. ""). When extracting Concepts, make them singular.
2. Extract occurrences of Instance, which are instantiated objects of the Concepts that you extracted in the previous step. Instances often follow Concepts and are always enclosed in quotes (i.e. "").
3. Extract description of Concepts and Instances, which are sentences to describe the meanings of Concepts and functions of Instances.
4. Use the chat history and do not extract Concepts that have previously been extracted before.
5. Your answer should be in the form of the following JSON format :
{"Requirement": ${requirement statement},
 "GID": ${GID of the requirement statement},
 "Concept": ${Concept}, "Concept_description": ${Concept description},
 "Instance":${instance that conform to the Concept}, "Instance_of": ${Concept of which the Instance is an instance}, "Instance_description": ${Instance description}
 "Requirement_type" : ${The type of the requirement, e.g. Functional, Non-Functional},
 "Non-Requirement_type": ${The types of Non-Functional requirement, separated by comma. This should be null for Functional requirements.}
}
6. For a requirement statement with multiple occurrences of Concept and Instance, please create a JSON list with multiple JSON entries, like so:
[
    $JSON entry,
    $JSON entry,
    ...
    $JSON entry
]
