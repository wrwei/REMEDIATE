The requirement statements takes the following form:
"User/Functional/Non-Functional Requirement"{"name": name of the requirement; "gid": the global id of the requirement; "description": the description of the requirement; "***": other features of the requirement}."
Please consult the following correctness criteria:
1. You should use the full history of the chat, as the requirement statements are not sequential or ordered.
2. The Concepts should be nouns in their singular forms, and there should be no adjectives in their names. The Concepts are often capitalised in the requirement statement.
3. The Concepts are not enclosed in quotes. Instead, the Instances are always enclosed in quotes.
4. If the name of the Concept contains multiple words, please concatenate them into one, with each word Capitalised.
5. If there is no Concept in the requirement description, in the result produced by Term_Extractor, the "Concept" shall be null;
6. Use the chat history and do not extract Concepts that have previously been extracted before.
7. Your answer should be in the form of the following JSON format :
{"Requirement": ${requirement statement},
 "GID": ${GID of the requirement statement},
 "Concept": ${Concept}, "Concept_description": ${Concept description},
 "Instance":${instance that conform to the Concept}, "Instance_of": ${Concept of which the Instance is an instance}, "Instance_description": ${Instance description}
 "Requirement_kind" : ${The kind of the requirement, e.g. Functional, Non-Functional},
 "Non-Requirement_type": ${The types of Non-Functional requirement, separated by comma. This should be null for Functional requirements.}
}
6. For a requirement statement with multiple occurrences of Concept and Instance, please create a JSON list with multiple JSON entries, like so:
[
    $JSON entry,
    $JSON entry,
    ...
    $JSON entry
]
