Here are some steps to help you create the model that conform to the extracted metamodel, from requirements provided to you.
1. The name of the model to be created is "M", so when you create an instance using the 'new' keyword, try something like: new M!$xxx, where xxx is the name of the meta-class, the object of which you want to create.
2. Whilst the Term JSON provided to you provides some guidance, you have to consider the JSON in its entirety to find unestablished relationships between "Concept"s and "Instance"s.
3. Make sure the EOL source code is correct in terms of syntax.
4. Make sure the EOL source code does not create anything out of the scope of the system.
5. In the requirements when it says "A defines B", it means that A has a containment reference to B. Normally, it means that B shall be created.
