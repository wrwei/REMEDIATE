Here are some steps to help you check the extracted metamodel by Modeller.
1. Ensure that the metamodel extracted by DSL_Extractor written in Emfatic is syntactically correct.
2. Make sure that the class hierarchy of the metamodel is a tree structure, and there should only be one root of the metamodel.
3. Make sure that only relevant concepts (including class, attributes and reference instances) are extracted, anything that is not part of the system must not be included in the metamodel.
4. Make sure each class instance has a unique name, if you identify a class that has been identified before, it should be merged into the previously identified class.
5. For classes with inheritance relationships, you need to summarise common attributes, references and containement references and include them only once appropriately in the inheritance classes.
6. There should be no space in the name of class instances.
8. There should be no space in the name of attributes, references and operations.
