This is the RoboChart model for a simple random walk:

stm SRWSTM {
	uses EventIntf requires SRWIntf initial i0
	state Move {
		entry steps = Update ( steps , MaxSteps , x == 0 )
	}
probabilistic p0
	transition t0 {
		from i0
		to Move
	}
	transition t1 {
		from Move
		to p0
	condition x < MaxDist /\ x > - MaxDist /\ steps < MaxSteps
	}
	transition t2 {
		from p0
		to Move
	probability 1 - Pl
		action
	x = Plus ( x , MaxDist ) ; right
	}
	transition t3 {
		from p0
		to Move
	probability Pl
		action
	x = Minus ( x , - MaxDist ) ; left
	}
	transition t4 {
		from Move
		to Move
		condition x >= MaxDist /\ steps < MaxSteps
		action

	x = Minus ( x , - MaxDist ) ; left
	}
	transition t5 {
		from Move
		to Move
		condition x <= - MaxDist /\ steps < MaxSteps
		action

	x = Plus ( x , MaxDist ) ; right
	}
state Stuck {
	}
transition t6 {
		from Move
		to Stuck
		condition steps == MaxSteps
	}
}
