Based on the provided functional and non-functional requirements, I will create a state machine named "LRE_Beh" using the DSL syntax that conforms to the examples given. This state machine will model the behavior of the LRE (Long Range Explorer) with the specified states, transitions, variables, constants, events, and functions.

This state machine "LRE_Beh" models the behavior of the LRE according to the specified requirements. It includes the defined states (OCM, MOM, CAM, HCM), transitions, variables, constants, events, and functions. The transitions are specified with triggers, conditions, and actions as required.
