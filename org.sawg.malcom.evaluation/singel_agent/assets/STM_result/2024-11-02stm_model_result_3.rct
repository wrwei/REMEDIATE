Based on the provided functional and non-functional requirements, we can create a state machine named `LRE_Beh` that models the behavior of the LRE. The state machine will include the states, transitions, variables, constants, events, and functions as specified in the requirements. Here's how the DSL code for the state machine might look:

```plaintext
stm LRE_Beh {
    // Required Interfaces
    requires AUV_Platform

    // Initial State
    initial i0

    // States
    state OCM {
        // Transitions within OCM
        transition t1 {
            from OCM
            to OCM
            trigger reqVel ? x
            action advVel ! x
        }
        transition t2 {
            from OCM
            to OCM
            trigger reqHdng ? x
            action advHdng ! x
        }
    }

    state MOM {
        entry advVel ! 1
        transition t5 {
            from MOM
            to OCM
            condition inOPEZ
        }
        transition t6 {
            from MOM
            to OCM
            trigger reqOCM
        }
        transition t7 {
            from MOM
            to OCM
            trigger endTask
            action advVel ! 0
        }
        transition t8 {
            from MOM
            to CAM
            condition CDA < MinSafeDist /\ TCPA >= 0
        }
        transition t9 {
            from MOM
            to HCM
            condition hvel >= 0.1 /\ hdist(cstc) < StaticObsHorizDist
        }
        transition t10 {
            from MOM
            to HCM
            condition vdist(cstc) <= StaticObsDfltVertDist
        }
        transition t11 {
            from MOM
            to HCM
            condition vvel >= 0.1 /\ vdist(cstc) < StaticObsVertDist
        }
        transition t12 {
            from MOM
            to HCM
            trigger reqHCM
        }
    }

    state CAM {
        transition t17 {
            from CAM
            to OCM
            trigger reqOCM
        }
        transition t18 {
            from CAM
            to OCM
            condition CDA >= MinSafeDist
        }
    }

    state HCM {
        entry advVel ! 0.1
        transition t13 {
            from HCM
            to MOM
            condition hdist(cstc) > StaticObsHorizDist /\ vdist(cstc) > StaticObsVertDist
        }
        transition t14 {
            from HCM
            to CAM
            condition CDA < MinSafeDist /\ TCPA >= 0
        }
        transition t15 {
            from HCM
            to OCM
            trigger reqOCM
        }
        transition t16 {
            from HCM
            to OCM
            condition inOPEZ
        }
    }

    // Transitions from Initial State
    transition t0 {
        from i0
        to OCM
    }

    // Variables
    var cobs: Close
    var inOPEZ: boolean
    var hvel: real
    var vvel: real
    var cstc: Obstacle
    var cdyn: Obstacle
    var depth: real
    var CDA: real
    var TCPA: real
    var x: real

    // Constants
    const AvoidanceMargin: real
    const StaticObsHorizDist: real
    const StaticObsVertDist: real
    const MinSafeDist: real
    const StaticObsDfltVertDist: real

    // Events
    event reqVel
    event advVel
    event reqHdng
    event advHdng
    event reqMOM
    event reqOCM
    event endTask
    event reqHCM

    // Functions
    function odist(o: Obstacle): real
    function hdist(o: Obstacle): real
    function vdist(o: Obstacle): real
}
```

### Explanation:

- **States**: The state machine includes states OCM, MOM, CAM, and HCM, as specified in the requirements.
- **Transitions**: Transitions are defined based on the conditions and triggers provided in the requirements. Each transition specifies the source and target states, any trigger events, conditions, and actions.
- **Variables and Constants**: Variables and constants are declared at the state machine level, as specified in the non-functional requirements.
- **Events**: Events are defined and used as triggers for transitions.
- **Functions**: Functions `odist`, `hdist`, and `vdist` are defined as required by the functional requirements.

This DSL code captures the behavior of the LRE as described in the requirements, using the syntax and semantics of the provided examples.
