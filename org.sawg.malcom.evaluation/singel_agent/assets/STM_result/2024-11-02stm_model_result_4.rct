Based on the provided functional and non-functional requirements, we can define a state machine named `LRE_Beh` that models the behavior of the LRE (Long Range Explorer). This state machine will include the states, transitions, variables, constants, events, and functions as specified in the requirements.

Here is the DSL code for the `LRE_Beh` state machine:

```plaintext
stm LRE_Beh {
    // Required Interfaces
    requires AUV_Platform

    // Initial State
    initial i0

    // States
    state OCM {
        // No specific entry action
    }
    state MOM {
        entry advVel ! 1
    }
    state CAM {
        // No specific entry action
    }
    state HCM {
        entry advVel ! 0.1
    }

    // Variables
    var cobs: Close
    var inOPEZ: boolean
    var hvel: real
    var vvel: real
    var cstc: Obstacle
    var cdyn: Obstacle
    var depth: real
    var CDA: real
    var TCPA: real
    var x: real

    // Constants
    const AvoidanceMargin: real
    const StaticObsHorizDist: real
    const StaticObsVertDist: real
    const MinSafeDist: real
    const StaticObsDfltVertDist: real

    // Events
    event reqVel
    event reqHdng
    event reqMOM
    event reqOCM
    event reqHCM
    event endTask
    event advVel
    event advHdng

    // Functions
    function odist(o: Obstacle): real
    function hdist(o: Obstacle): real
    function vdist(o: Obstacle): real

    }
    transition t6 {
        from MOM
        to CAM
        condition CDA < MinSafeDist /\ TCPA >= 0
    }
    transition t7 {
        from MOM
        to OCM
        trigger endTask
        action advVel ! 0
    }
    transition t8 {
        from MOM
        to HCM
        condition hvel >= 0.1 /\ hdist(cstc) < StaticObsHorizDist
    }
    transition t9 {
        from MOM
        to HCM

        condition vvel >= 0.1 /\ vdist(cstc) < StaticObsVertDist
    }
    transition t11 {

        to HCM
        trigger reqHCM

    transition t12 {
        from HCM
        to MOM
        condition hdist(cstc) > StaticObsHorizDist /\ vdist(cstc) > StaticObsVertDist
    }
    transition t13 {
        from HCM
        to CAM
        condition CDA < MinSafeDist /\ TCPA >= 0
    }
    transition t14 {
        from HCM
        to OCM
        trigger reqOCM
    }
    transition t15 {
        from HCM

    transition t16 {
        from CAM

    transition t17 {

This DSL code defines the `LRE_Beh` state machine with the specified states, transitions, variables, constants, events, and functions. The transitions include triggers, conditions, and actions as described in the requirements.
