Here are some steps to help you create JSON trace, from the EOL code and the requirements provided to you.
1. The name of the model to be created is "M".
2. Identify class objects created by the EOL code (in EOL, the creation normally starts with keyword "new"), record the name of their class.
3. Identify relevant objects' attributes set by the EOL code, record the name of the attributes.
4. Identify relevant objects' references set by the EOL code, record the name of the attributes.
5. For multiple occurrences of the above, please create a JSON list with multiple JSON entries, like so:
[
    $JSON entry,
    $JSON entry,
    ...
    $JSON entry
]
